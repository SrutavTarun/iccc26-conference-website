Electronics from the University of Kerala, studying there from 1987 to 1991. He led Hitachi Energy's
second and one of India's longest ultrahigh-voltage direct current transmission link projects, running
from Raigarh in central India to Pugalur in Tamil Nadu from 2016 onwards. He also headed the upgrade
work of India's oldest commercial HVDC link between Rihand in Uttar Pradesh and Dadri near Delhi.
He spearheaded ABB's first industrial drive factory setup in India and the establishment of its solar
inverters business here. With close to three decades of experience in the Automation & Energy domain,
Saji has handled diverse leadership roles at ABB ranging from Asst. Vice President of LV Drive Systems
and Renewable Business to Vice President Power Systems. In these roles, he has helped shape Hitachi
Energy offerings, ensuring high quality products and services for customers. For more than 25 years,
ABB has supported India's HVDC journey, and Saji has seen all of it. He is well-versed with the
country's power sector and energy challenges and believes UHVDC will play a large part in India's
energy revolution.`,
